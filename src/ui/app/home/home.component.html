  <!-- First paragraph providing information about the size and ranking of the CS Department -->
  <p>
    With nearly 80 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is
    the largest department in the College of Engineering and Computing, one
    of the largest departments on campus, and the largest, fastest growing,
    and highest ranked Computer Science department in the Commonwealth of
    Virginia.

  <!-- Second paragraph emphasizing the pervasive nature of computing in society and its interdisciplinary applications -->
  <p>
    Today, not only is computing pervasive in society, but computational
    methods are used in almost every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from
    the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering, as well as
    every sector of industry. Given the importance of computing in today's
    world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", providing a
    diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all
    backgrounds and at all levels.
